Write a golang/PHP application that is ready to be deployed. 

It should call exchangeratesapi to get the latest exchange rates of base currencies of GBP and USD. 

It should return the value of 1 GBP or 1 USD in euros. 

It should check the value against the historic rate for the last week and make a naive recommendation of whether it is a good time to exchange money or not.
